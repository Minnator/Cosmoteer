"# Cosmoteer-Syntax-Language by Minnator" 

This is a project to offer an up to date language and Autocompletion for the modding Syntax of "Cosmoteer" for Notepadd++.

Installation steps for Cosmoteer modding language:
1. Download both files.
2. Open Notepad++ and navigate to "Language>User Definded Language>Open User Definded Language Folder"
3. Copy the "Cosmoteer.xml" file in there.
4. To select the Cosmoteer language simply navigate to "language" and choose it from the drop down menu

Installation steps for Cosmoteer autocompletion:
1. Navigate to the installation of your Notepadd++ and to the autocompletion folder ( should be: C:\Program Files\Notepad++\autoCompletion)
2. Paste the "Cosmoteer A.xml" into this folder
--> The autocompletion is now always enabled if you have the Cosmoteer modding language selected for the file you are editing.

If there are any problems let me know so I can fix them.
